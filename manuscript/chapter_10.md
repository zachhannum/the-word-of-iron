# Chapter Ten
## The Boundless Forest

Hawthorne took them out of the city and into the forest. He still had not explained what they were doing or where they were headed, and Marcus was beginning to question his decision to come along. Rykker, Sev, and Viggo had also decided to take Mara up on her offer. Len had stayed behind to meet with Senna’s Governor and bring news of Gareth's death, but also to help the Vallan refugees that found their way to the city. Mara, too, stayed in the city, claiming she had business elsewhere. She had wished them luck, assuring that they were in good hands.

Marcus felt as if he was abandoning everything as he always did. But that was what he did, was it not? Run? First Sen, his village, his kinsmen. And now his country. At the first chance he got, he ran from his problems when they became too big for him. In this case, though, did he have a choice? If what Mara said was true—if she was right about the role they had to play in all of this, then just maybe he was where he was supposed to be. He hoped he wasn't being played for a fool and falling into bad habits.

Their new guide took them deep into the wood north of Senna, outside of any road or well-traveled path. It was early morning, yet the sun barely pierced the thick canopy of the trees. It felt more like a perpetual twilight, and Marcus couldn't help but imagine that they were in another world entirely. A muffled quiet lay across the wilderness, as if all manner of creature, even insects stayed clear of the area.

Hawthorne led the way through the dense undergrowth without pause or so much as a look back. Surprisingly, Viggo and Rykker had barely said a word since leaving the city. This came as a shock to Marcus—they seemed to always have an opinion on everything. Perhaps the fear of the unknown, of what awaited, gave them pause. Or perhaps they were simply too fixated on their own thoughts. On the things they had learned these past few days. He certainly was.

Marcus tensed as he felt Hawthorne's pace slow and become more deliberate, as if sensing for something. Then, they stepped into a small glade, just enough for each of them to have a space to stand. A stone monolith stood at the center of the clearing, slightly taller than Marcus. It looked old—no, ancient. Even older than the fateful temple they had found themselves in after the fall of Valla. Harsh, angular runes etched their way across its surface in a language that he did not recognize. Although the stone was rough with wear, pocked and eroded in places, the runes themselves were still legible. The monolith, slightly askew, protruded from a small crater in the earth where no grass or shrub grew. A perfect circle encompassed the obelisk.

Marcus kept his distance from the thing—it was probably best to be cautious. Rykker pushed his way past, eyes locked on the slab. He nearly took a step down into the pit before Hawthorne reached out to stop him.

"Wait," the tall man said, reaching out to stop him.

"What is it?" Rykkers eyes did not leave the center of the clearing. He brushed away Hawthorne’s grip.

"It is a gateway. A way to go where we need to go. To the Boundless Forest. Stay here." Without further explaination, Hawthorne dropped his pack on the ground and climbed down into the crater and approached the monolith. It seemed to shrink in the presence of him. Marcus could not tell if that was a trick of the eye or something else.

Hawthorne laid a thin hand upon the stone and began to speak. Marcus frowned, realizing that he could not understand what the man was saying. No, that wasn't quite right. The words themselves vanished before him, snatched from the space between hearing and understanding. He was sure that the Hawthorne was talking, but the harder Marcus tried to focus on them, the more they slipped away. A faint white light shone from beneath the hand on the stone, spreading outwards to encompass the entire pillar. 

The light grew until Marcus could not keep his eyes open. He threw his arm up to protect his face as the illumation became blinding. As quickly as it came, it was gone. For a moment, patterns danced in the darkness, and he squeezed his eyes shut before open them, blinking the momentary bluriness away.

When his vision returned, his first thought was that nothing had changed. It did not take long, however, for his senses to make the hairs on the back of his neck stand on end. Although the clearing they now stood in looked nearly identical, Marcus was sure that they were no longer mere miles from Senna. Something about the way the air felt, the thickness of it, and the sky—he was sure the light was different here. More gray, somehow.

"Where are we?" he asked.

Hawthorne released his touch of the monolith and took a step back, looking around. For the first time, Marcus noticed a small smile. "This is Indenos. The Boundless Forest. The Wood."

The air was thicker here. The effort required to draw breath required that the act be a conscious effort.  Upon closer examination of his surroundings, Marcus saw that the trees here where unlike anything he had ever seen. Pale, knurled trunks thicker than his wingspan ascended to towering heights. Twisting leaves longer than his forearm sprouted from a multitude of branches. They seemed to reach for him, beckoning to step into their dark embrace. A faint dusk cast sleeping shadows that crawled along the undergrowth.

"Inde—What?" said Rykker. He took a few tentative steps towards one of the trees, reaching out slowly as if contemplating whether the thing was going to snatch him up. "What happened? Was that Magic?"

"Yes." Hawthorne climbed out of the crater. Dusting off his dark pants, he said, "I wouldn’t touch that if I were you."

Rykker’s hand snapped back. "Why not? Is it poisonous?"

"I don’t think so, but the Forest doesn’t typically like to be messed with."

"Doesn’t *like* it?" Marcus said. He peered again into the tree line, trying to see if the branches were moving in accordance with the slight breeze or not.

Hawthorne shrugged. "I just think it’s best to be safe when it comes to these matters."

"Well, Okay," Viggo said. carefully stepping away from some of the undergrowth. "But you still haven’t explained *where* we are."

Their indiscernible guide collected his belongings from the ground and slung them across his back. "Let’s get going. I’ll explain along the way."

***

As it turned out, the Forest remained docile, even as they tramped through the heavy wood. There was no path to follow, and Marcus wondered how Hawthorne knew the way. It had been at least an hour. Maybe more? It was hard to tell, here—the angle of shadows had not changed in all the time since they had left the clearing. Disconcerted though Marcus was, Hawthorne led on with a confident stride, picking his way through the dense trees.

"Indenos is not of the world you know," Hawthorne explained. "You could not point to it on any map on Asdel. It is… outside of our world."

"We’re on another world?" Rykker gingerly pushed a branch back as he stepped forward.

"Sort of, I guess you could think of it as such. But it is no so simple. The Forest *was* another world, long ago. It was dying, and the old magi of our world siezed it, lashing it to our own. They bent Indenos for their own needs, warping the land. They created the Monoliths, and now this place is bound to ours in many places. But these links—while they are many miles apart in our world—are not so far in this one. The magi used the Forest to traverse their great Empire, taking journeys of a thousand miles in a few days."

"Unbelievable." Rykker shook his head with awe. "Sev, you think you’ve been here before?"

"I don’t know." The Aeonnar trod lightly considering his size, keeping to the rear of the pack. IT sometimes amazed Marcus at how invisible the goliath could be. He tended to just blend in to the background most of the time. "I wish I could remember, Rykker."

The engineer glanced back at Sev and grinned, an uncharacteristic twinkle in his eye. "That’s alright, Sev. We’ll figure you out. Just wait."

"So this place," Marcus said. "It’s going to get us to Antuza?"

"Yes." Hawthorne slowed his pace as he worked his way around a thick bush of thorny vines. "I think our path will take us no more than a day, although such timekeeping methods will be all but useless here."

"Yeah, I’ve notice that."

"There is no ‘sun’, so to speak, in Indenos. The light we have here is a remnant of the magi that once maintained it. Eventually, it will go out, and the Forest will be plunged into darkness. Even the trees were cared for by the wizards. It is said that there used to be great avenues leading from one Monolith to the other. The Forest allowed for unmitigated trade between nations all across Asdel. It's no wonder the magi ruled the world."

Marcus looked around at the trees, with their incomprehensibly thick trunks and towering height. They must be thousands of years old. What kind of power must one yield to tame such giants?

"How do you know all of this?" asked Rykker. "I’ve read a lot of books about the magi and I’ve never even heard of this place."

"Most of the books you find about the magi barely have any truth left in them." Hawthorne spoke matter-of-factly, though Marcus felt Rykker tense up. "But I’ve spent my entire life dedicated to learning all that I can about this place. Its history. How it was created. Reading the runes. Traversing its expanse.  Unlocking every secret behind every leaf."

Rykker stomped over a bush more forcefully than necessary.

Hawthorne glanced back at the sound of a branch snapping. "I’d be happy to share my knowledge, Mr. Rykker. Should you survive your journey to the Empire, it would be my pleasure to impart what I have learned."

"Why would you—"

Before Rykker could finish his sentence, a guttural cry bellowed overhead.

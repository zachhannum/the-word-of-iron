# Chapter 11
## Valley of Frost

The tempest that struck the Siunna Valley filled the vale with snow and ice. The trees of this new forest, unprepared for the sudden winter, recoiled from the cold, their green leaves now frosted over. A deluge of heavy flakes and howling wind confronted them as they exited the treeline. Standing atop a knoll, Viggo studied the landscape before them. Siunna was quite small, surrounded on all sides by well-worn mountains that seemed to fade into the distance, heavy fog obscuring their view even from this height. A steady river bisected the valley, snaking its way through the terrain as if searching for an escape from the mountains and canyons that kept it from the sea.

Gyim. In a matter of hours, they had traveled all the way to Gyim, across the Plys sea to the continent of Kador. Gyim was, of course, on the wrong side of the continent, near the northern tip. Antuza made up the southern coast of Kador. They were many hundreds of miles from their destination, but Hawthorne assured them that the Indenos did not work linearly, and that this Lith had been ‘on the way’. Viggo did not even attempt to understand the laws of such things. 

Ever since leaving Senna, this world of myth and magic and legends had left him feeling dour. From his experience, those that dabbled in such arts had no good intentions. He thought back to that day in the church. The day that any chance he had at finding out where he came from—who his parents were—had disappeared. The church and all its ilk had thrown him out all because of what he had seen. Magic. He never could figure out what *exactly* they were doing. He had often thought about going back. To try and uncover their secrets. But the truth was that he never wanted to. He had found comfort in his new life. First as a blacksmith, then as a medic. But still, there was always that inkling—that shred of doubt that plauged his thoughts. Perhaps his parents had been nothing.  Derelicts that had pawned him off to the church at the first opportunity. Something, *something* told him there was more. A belief. A hope that there was some grand purpose to it all. All throughout his life he had held firm to that hope, stronger than any faith he ever put into the gods. He longed for a greater meaning to his life.

He shook off his thoughts as they approached a narrow pathway carved into the side of a steep canyon. With practiced steps, Hawthorne led them down the precarious footpath. The trail had been made for access to the Lith, Viggo had no doubt.

Ice and snow covered the ground, crunching under their inadequate boots. Viggo shivered. His thin jerkin could not stop the frozen wind from chilling his bones. From their vantage, Viggo could just make out the city, nestled deep in the valley below.
